# Betamore: Applications of Data Science
#### Spring 2017

***INSTRUCTOR***

Hunter Jackson

*	Chief Scientific Officer at [Proscia](https://www.proscia.com)
*	Ph.D. Candidate in Mathematics at [Hopkins](https://www.math.jhu.edu)

***COURSE OUTLINE***

Each class will be an engaging, interactive session where we build tools together to make predictions about our data. The classes will be focused on actually building the predictive tools; however, each class will have supplementary lecture notes that describe the methodologies in further detail and extra programming tasks if anyone wants extra practice.
