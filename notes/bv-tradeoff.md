# Bias Variance Tradeoff questions

1. In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response?
2. Is this a regression or classification problem?
3. In the interactive visualization, try using different values for K across different sets of training data. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?
4. In the visualization, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? 
5. How is the darkness calculated?
6. How does the choice of K affect model bias? How about variance?
7. As you experiment with K and generate new training data, how can you "see" high versus low variance? How can you "see" high versus low bias?
8. Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
9. Does a high value for K cause over-fitting or under-fitting?
