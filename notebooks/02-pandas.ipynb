    "1. It is very easy to want to edit previous python cells. Until you're really confortatable with Notebook, please don't! Everything that you run stays **in the notebook**, so the moment you accidentally delete code that you might have been using, you lose your work the next time you run the notebook.\n",
    "2. The `mode` of Notebook is very similar to vim, so vim users should feel comfortable:\n",
    "    1. The natural mode is a command mode. If you press `esc`, you should be in this mode. It's for gettinng around, changing cell types, and other commands. While in command mode, if you press `h`, it'll let you know anything else you can do.\n",
    "    2. The other primary mode is edit mode. Pressing `return` on a cell will put you into edit mode (this would be similar to pressing `i` or `a` in vim). It's for editing cells, be they headers, markdown, code. We won't need nbconvert for the purposes of this course.\n",
